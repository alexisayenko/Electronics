FTDI is a company producing chip for converting Serial protocol (RX, TX) to USB signals.

<Screenshot in working state with red LED on>

The YP-05 module has power switch, which gives output of 4.80 or 3.46 <Screenshot>. So its better not to use it as power supply source.

In order to test it send data from one port to anther using FTDI board and Arduino. <Schematics>
From USB it goes to ftdi, from ftdi to arduino pins 2 and 3. from arduino it goes to second USB port.

Upload the sketch.

SoftwareSerial does not work correctly with 115200. Hence, use 9600.

In my case those USBs are COM3 and COM4

open two Serial Monitors for both ports
